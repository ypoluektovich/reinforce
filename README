Reinforce will help you build your project.
(It's not like I wrote her for you or anything, you d-dummy!)

The point is to have a build description that:
 - is clean and clear, as opposed to maven's pom;
 - is declarative, as opposed to ant's build.xml;
 - doesn't make you keep track of stuff you don't care about,
   like cleaning the build dir, or where exactly the class files get dumped;
 - doesn't attempt to decide important things for you,
   as opposed to anything with a predefined 'default' build sequence.

Disclaimer:
  Currently Reinforce is pre-release.
  She lacks a lot of features that are common among the more mature builders.
  Use at your own risk and frustration.

Dependencies:
 - Java 1.7
 - Snakeyaml 1.11
 - Ivy 2.3.0
 - JUnit 4.11 (and its transitive dependency, hamcrest-core 1.3)
This list might not be up-to-date. The definitive source on the dependencies
is the src/*/ivy.xml files.

Build time dependencies:
 - some kind of Linux (look at *.sh to see why);
 - an Ivy installation that provides the `ivy' executable.

This command will build Reinforce from scratch:
$ ./build-full.sh
If all goes well, this will create the file build/reinforce.jar.
