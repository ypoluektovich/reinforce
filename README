Reinforce will help you build your project.
(It's not like I wrote her for you or anything, you d-dummy!)

The point is to have a build description that:
 - is clean and clear, as opposed to maven's pom;
 - is declarative, as opposed to ant's build.xml;
 - doesn't make you keep track of stuff you don't care about,
   like cleaning the build dir, or where exactly the class files get dumped;
 - doesn't attempt to decide important things for you,
   as opposed to anything with a predefined 'default' build sequence.

Disclaimer:
  Currently Reinforce is pre-release.
  She lacks a lot of features that are common among the more mature builders.
  Use at your own risk and frustration.

Core dependencies:
 - Java 1.7
 - snakeyaml 1.11

Build time dependencies:
 - some kind of Linux (look at *.sh to see why)
 - curl (for third party library retrieval)

Runtime dependencies:
 - all build dependencies
 - tools.jar from the Oracle JDK distribution
   (though only if you use the javac target)

To build Reinforce from scratch, run:
$ ./retrieve.lib.sh
$ ./build.sh

After that's done, Reinforce can build herself:
$ java -cp reinforce.jar:tools.jar jar
